🔍 Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering
I'm excited to share a recent project where I applied unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their behaviors and attributes.

Using KMeans Clustering, I was able to group customers into distinct clusters, helping businesses better understand their customer base and make data-driven decisions. This technique is especially valuable for personalized marketing, improving customer experience, and strategic planning.
